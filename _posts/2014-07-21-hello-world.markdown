We're very excited to announce the GDG Mentor connect program. GDG Mentor connect is a program intended to connect local community mentors to other community members and slowly building a platform for everyone to share, code and learn together. 

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Experienced people all domains**: we're expecting over 50+ mentors
* **One to One help**: You can reach out to our mentors for one to one help
* **Solution for everything**: We intend to build this network in such a way that you will be able to reachout to someone in every technology question you have.

but we've already secured a first batch of mentors:

* **Amrit Sanjeev** - Developer Relation from Google, who excited about Android Technologies<br>
* **Romin Irani** - Cloud GDE<br>
* **Shibu Basheer** - CTO of Cabot<br>
* **Praseed Pai** - Web developer<br>


More details will be published soon.
