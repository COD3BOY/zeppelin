  title: "A Coding Ninja from Cabot."
  description: "Javascript, PhantomJS, CasperJS, Cocos2d-JS & iOS is being currently used by me in Cabot Technologies. I have been using these for the past 1 year.I have been working on php and mysql from my college days (for about 3 years). I had been working on core php only. I am trying out Mozilla & Chrome addon development now. Being a mentor at GDG is a great privilege for me. I always wanted to share the knowledge that i have with others and i strongly believe GDG will be a platform for that. Apart from sharing knowledge i will be able to interact with many people and thus i can get myself updated about technologies which i am not working on."
