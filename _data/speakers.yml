  bio: "Amrit proudly admits to being a geek.I loved computers from a very young age. I think I was in 9th standard when there was this one time that I couldn’t get something to work. My father introduced me to the computer admin of his company to help me out with my issue. So I went to him with a floppy disk with my program in it and he saw many files in it. So he asked me how many lines of code are actually there? and I said about 10000 and he asked me to come and see him the next day. That night he called my parents and asked them to encourage me in what I was doing as he thought I had some talent in this area. Amrit says that he always understood languages quite well but college taught him more about algorithms and data structures."
